Due to time constraints, we provide a demo of STCT here.
If you want to use this code, it is necessary to pre-train a model using SimCLR and extract its embedding features.
When using this code, please execute step1-3 in sequence for one training epoch.
Upon completing step1-3 once, let stct_epoch += 1.
